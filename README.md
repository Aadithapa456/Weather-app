# Weather APP

As I am on my journey to learn JS, I wanted to make projects but I ran out of idea so I went straight to Google to search for some projects idea and I found about weather app and I started to research about it and to be honest initially I thought I couldn't do that but here I am pushing this code to my repository and hence it proves that I have the hunger to master JS.
